%%% Now define the boxes that make up the poster
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be in between, you
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle
%%% box.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  Identify enterprise work-flows for a PaaS application and build an application which allows --
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
      \item Identify and implement more enterprise work-flows
      \item Implement keystone authentication
      \item Abstract interface to create your own work-flows

   We designed and implemented a system which can take as an input an enterprise workflow and deploy it to the Openshift broker.

   Some salient features of our project are
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
   \item \texttt{HTML5} based drag and drop interface for building work-flows.
   \item Ability to deploy to all Openshift distributions
   \item Extensible
   \end{enumerate}
