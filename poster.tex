    \item \texttt{HTML5} based drag and drop interface for building work-flows.

    We would like to extend the application to managing deployed apps as well. Particularly, setting auto-scale parameters and controlling the life-cycle.

    We would also like to add a mechanism by which the user can directly deploy his code using our portal rather than having to synchronize \texttt{Git} repositories manually.
